# Data Preprocessing
#### Data Preprocessing is the process of cleaning data before it can be used as input to Machine Learning Models. Replacing missing values, Encoding, Feature Scaling, etc are a part of data preprocessing.

## Business Problem
#### The given dataset contains information related to people living in various countries and whether they brought a car or no. The data is unclean and needs to be cleaned.

## Processing
#### The missing values in the dataset were replaced by the mean of that column. Encoding was done on the country and the purchased column, followed by feature scaling the dependent variables.

## Template
#### A template for data preprocessing is also given in this folder. It can be used as a starting point for data cleaning for other projects as well.
