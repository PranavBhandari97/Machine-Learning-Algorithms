# Grid Search
#### Grid Search is a parameter tuning method used to get the best parameters so that the model can be tuned and better accuracies can be achieved.

## Business Problem
#### The dataset contains information for a Social Media platform. Companies can advertise their products on this platform. Recently, one of the advertisers launched a highly-priced SUV, and its ads were shown on the platform. The goal is to build a classification model that can predict which users brought the car.

## Model
#### Kernel SVM is used in both Python&R for classification.

## Accuracy
| Language | Before Grid Search | After Grid Search |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python | 89.72% | 90.33% |
| R | 91.05% | 91.27% |

## Visualization
#### The folder contains the visuals generated in R. The visuals produced in Python can be found in the Python notebook.
