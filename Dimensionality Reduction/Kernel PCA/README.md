# Kernel PCA

## Business Problem
#### The dataset contains information for a Social Media platform. Companies can advertise their products on this platform. Recently, one of the advertisers launched a highly-priced SUV, and its ads were shown on the platform. The goal is to build a classification model that can predict which users brought the car.

## Model
#### The Kernel PCA model reduced the number of features to two and was built using that.
#### Logistic Regression was used for classification in both Python and R.

## Accuracy
#### Python : 93%
#### R : 83%

## Visualization
#### The folder contains the visuals generated in R. The visuals produced in Python can be found in the Python notebook.
