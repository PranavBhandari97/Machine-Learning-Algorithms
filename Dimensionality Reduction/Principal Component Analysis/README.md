# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
#### PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique used to reduce the number of input variables.
 
## Business Problem
#### The dataset contains information about wine and the customer segments which choose which type of wine. The problem was to classify the choices. Dimensionality reduction was to be used to reduce the number of input variables.
 
## Model
#### The model contained 13 input variables. Using PCA, the variance for the 13 variables was calculated. Observing the variance, it was seen that two variances covered 55% of the dataset, and thus, those two were chosen.
#### In Python, Logistic Regression was used for classification.
#### In R, SVM was used for classification.
 
## Accuracy
#### In both Python&R, an accuracy of 97% was achieved.
 
##Visualization
#### The folder contains the visuals generated in R. The visuals produced in Python can be found in the Python notebook.
 
## Other Model
#### Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) can also be used to solve the same problem. The link to the solution using LDA can be found below.
