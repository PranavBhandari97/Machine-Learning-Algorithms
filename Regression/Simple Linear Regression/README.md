# Simple Linear Regression

## Business Problem
#### The dataset contains information regarding the years of experience an employee has and the salary that he/she is being paid. The company is a Start-up and thus, the salaries are being set a bit arbitrarily with a range rather than taking the years experience in account and deriving a formula. The aim of the project is to build a Linear Regression Model to see if a formula can be derived using the given dataset and to visualize how the current salaries and the predicted salaries correlate to the years of experience.
