# Multiple Linear Regression

## Business Problem
#### The dataset provided contains the information for 50 Start-up companies.  It includes details like R&D spent, Administration costs, Marketing Costs, State of Origin, and Profit. This project aims to design a model that can suitably predict the profit based on the input parameters using Multiple Linear Regression and also finding which parameter correlates the most directly with the predicted profit.

## Model
#### In Python, the model was designed considering all 4 parameters.
#### In R, R squared, Adjusted R squared, and p values were used to eliminate parameters so that the best model and the highly correlating parameters could be determined.
#### It was found that R&D spend is the parameter that contributes the most to the profit as it had the highest p-value.
#### Model designed containing the R&D spend and Marketing together gave good results as well.
