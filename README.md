# Machine Learning Algorithms
### This repo contains all the basic Machine Learning algorithms for Regression, Classification, Deep Learning, Clustering, etc.
### Majority of the algorithms are coded; in Python as well as R.
### CNN is implemented only in Python, and Eclat is implemented only in R.
### This repo also contains a Data Preprocessing folder with a template for preprocessing for Machine Learning.
### All the algorithms are implemented in projects and real-world use cases.
