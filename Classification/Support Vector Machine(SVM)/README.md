# Support Vector Machine(SVM)

## Business Problem
#### The dataset contains information for a Social Media platform. Companies can advertise their products on this platform. Recently, one of the advertisers launched a highly-priced SUV, and its ads were shown on the platform. The goal is to build a classification model that can predict which users brought the car.

## Model
#### Support Vector Machine(SVM) was implemented to try and solve this problem. It was implemented in both Python and R. Accuracies achieved using models in both languages can be seen below.

## Accuracy
#### Python:  90% 
#### R:  80%

## Other Models
#### Other models like Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Kernel SVM, Random Forest, KNN, and Logistic Regression, were used as well to solve this problem. The table below shows their accuracies in both languages.

## Accuracy of other Models
| Model | Python | R |
| ---| --- | --- |
| Decision Tree | 91% | 83% |
| K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN) | 93% | 89% |
| Kernel SVM | 93% | 90% |
| Logistic Regression| 89% | 83% |
| Naive Bayes | 90% | 86% |
| Random Forest | 91% | 81% |
